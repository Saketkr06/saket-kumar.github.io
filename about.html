        <h3>Bosch:Data Scientist</h3>
        <h4>Project 1: EV Range Prediction System</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Developed a range prediction system for electric vehicles (EVs). We proficiently handled real-world EV data from the BMW i3(60 ah), encompassing environmental, vehicle, battery, and heating circuit data.</li>
            <li>Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify correlations and significant features affecting EV range. Employed data preprocessing techniques, including feature selection and normalization, to optimize model performance.</li>
            <li>Utilized Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Deep Neural Network algorithms for EV range prediction and employed Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify crucial features for improved model accuracy.</li>
            <li>Using the Random Forest algorithm, attaining an R-squared of up to 0.96. Produced models with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.006, indicating precise range predictions.</li>
            <li>Created a Digital twin model to simulate real-world EV range prediction scenarios and deployed the model on an AWS EC2 instance.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Project 2: Compatibility-Based Vehicular Ad-Hoc Reliable Routing</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Incorporated AI and ML techniques into vehicular networks to enhance proactive communication and predictive decision-making.</li>
            <li>Developed a reliable routing mechanism addressing multi-hop ad hoc communications challenges and dynamic high-mobility environments.</li>
            <li>Implemented a proactive approach to predicting connectivity duration using only the BSM location, velocity, and direction between vehicles.</li>
            <li>Assessed five machine-learning classification techniques using the Open Street Map dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.</li>
            <li>Conducted a comparative analysis of machine learning techniques based on established metrics such as accuracy, computational time, misclassification rate, and F1 score.</li>
        </ul>
