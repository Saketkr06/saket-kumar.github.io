        <div class="project">
            <h2>EV Range Prediction System</h2>
            <p>Developed a range prediction system for electric vehicles (EVs). We proficiently handled real-world EV data from the BMW i3(60 ah), encompassing environmental, vehicle, battery, and heating circuit data. Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify correlations and significant features affecting EV range. Employed data preprocessing techniques, including feature selection and normalization, to optimize model performance. Utilized Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, and Deep Neural Network algorithms for EV range prediction and employed Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify crucial features for improved model accuracy. Using the Random Forest algorithm, attaining an R-squared of up to 0.96. Produced models with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.006, indicating precise range predictions. Created a Digital twin model to simulate real-world EV range prediction scenarios and deployed the model on an AWS EC2 instance.</p>

            <h2>Compatibility-Based Vehicular Ad-Hoc Reliable Routing</h2>
            <p>Incorporated AI and ML techniques into vehicular networks to enhance proactive communication and predictive decision-making. Developed a reliable routing mechanism addressing multi-hop ad hoc communications challenges and dynamic high-mobility environments. Implemented a proactive approach to predicting connectivity duration using only the BSM location, velocity, and direction between vehicles. Assessed five machine-learning classification techniques using the Open Street Map dataset to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Conducted a comparative analysis of machine learning techniques based on established metrics such as accuracy, computational time, misclassification rate, and F1 score.</p>

            <h2>Auto Dataset mpg</h2>
            <p>Initial visual analysis indicates relationships between the independent variables (engine characteristics, body weight,
            etc.) and the dependent variable (mpg). A linear regression model is built, considering non-linear effects, interactions, and variable discretization. Model
            selection methods like Forward selection identify the most suitable model. A detailed diagnostic check, including residual analysis, is conducted to ensure the chosen model fits the data well and adheres to underlying model assumptions.</p>
